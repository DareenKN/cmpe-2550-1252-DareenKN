                    We all know what a professional is—or do we? For years, ACM has proclaimed that its members are part
                    of a computing profession. <span style="font-weight:bold; color:blue;">But is it really a
                        profession?</span> Many people describe themselves as "professionals" in the
                    colloquial sense of being paid to perform some specialized skill. Yet, only a few occupations are
                    regarded as professions in the legal sense. Courts do not consider athletes or chefs to be
                    professionals the way doctors and lawyers are. Likewise, courts have consistently excluded software
                    developers from that select group.

                    To understand why U.S. law does not recognize computing as a profession—and whether that
                    classification could be changed—calls for a fresh look at the law of professions. Why does the law
                    distinguish professionals from professionals such as mechanics or pilots? What would happen if
                    courts treated software developers like doctors or lawyers? What are professionals' legal duties of
                    care and how do they differ from ethical codes of conduct? Can one bootstrap the other?
