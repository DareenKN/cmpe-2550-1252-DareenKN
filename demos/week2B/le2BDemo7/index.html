            Citizens worldwide have demonstrated serious concerns regarding the management of personal information
            by online services. For instance, the 2015 Eurobarometer about data protection13 reveals that: 63% of
            citizens within the Eurpean Union (EU) do not trust online businesses, more than half do not like providing
            personal information in return for free services, and 53% do not like that Internet companies use their
            personal information in tailored advertising. Similarly, a recent survey carried out among U.S. users9
            reveals that 53% of respondents were against receiving tailored ads from the information websites and apps
            learn about them, 42% do not think websites care about using users data securely and responsibly at all, and
            73% considers websites know too much about users. A survey conducted by Internet Society (ISOC) in the
            Asia-Pacific region in 20168 disclosed that 59% of the respondent did not feel their privacy is sufficiently
            protected when using the Internet, and 45% considered getting the attention of policymakers in their country
            on data protection a matter or urgency.

            Policymakers have reacted to this situation by passing or proposing new regulations in the area of
            privacy and/or data protection. For instance, in May 2018, the EU enforced the General Data Protection
            Regulation (GDPR)6 across all 28 member states. Similarly, in June 2018, California passed the California
            Consumer Privacy Act,3 which is claimed to be the nation's toughest data privacy law. In countries like
            Argentina or Chile, the governments proposed new bills in 2017 updating their existing data protection
            regulation.11 For this article, we will take as reference the GDPR since it is the one affecting more
            countries, citizens, and companies.

            In a recent work, we demonstrated that Facebook (FB) labels 73% of users within the EU with potentially
            sensitive interests (referred to as ad preferences as well), which may contravene the GDPR. FB assigns
            user's different ad preferences based on their online activity within this social network. Advertisers
            running ad campaigns can target groups of users that have been assigned a particular ad preference (for
            example, target FB users interested in Starbucks). Some of these ad preferences may suggest political
            opinions (for example, Socialist party), sexual orientation (for example, homosexuality), personal health
            issues (for example, breast cancer awareness), and other potentially sensitive attributes. In the vast
            majority of the cases, the referred sensitive ad preferences are inferred from the user behavior in FB
            without obtaining explicit consent from the user. Then advertisers may reach FB users based on ad
            preferences tightly linked to sensitive information. For instance, one of the authors of this article
            received the ad shown in the figure below(left side). The text in the ad clearly reflects the ad was
            targeting homosexual people. The author had not explicitly defined his sexual orientation,
            but he discovered that FB had assigned him the "Homosexuality" ad preference.
